# CIFAR10-CNN-Classifier

This repository contains a project that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of this project is to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images.

## Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Implementation of a CNN model for image classification.
- Training, validation, and testing of the model.
- Visualization of training metrics and predictions.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains the following classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The dataset can be directly loaded using the `tensorflow.keras.datasets` module.
